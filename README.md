# The Holy Bible NABRE JSON Dataset

This repository contains New American Bible Revised Edition ([NABRE](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-American-Bible-Revised-Edition-NABRE-Bible/)) of The Holy Bible in JSON dataset along with the Bash script used to generate it.
The Bash script scrapes [biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-American-Bible-Revised-Edition-NABRE-Bible/#booklist) to get the verses for each chapter in each book. (Credits to [bible_verse-cli](https://github.com/RaynardGerraldo/bible_verse-cli) for the idea).
